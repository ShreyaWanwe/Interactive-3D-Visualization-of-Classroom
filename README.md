# Interactive-3D-Visualization-of-Classroom
Our project demonstrates the power of computer graphics in creating immersive and interactive experiences. Built using C++ and OpenGL, it showcases both fundamental and advanced concepts in computer graphics, offering a platform for visualization, experimentation, and creativity.

# Key Features:

✅ Menu-Driven Interface: Allows easy access to various computer graphics algorithms.<br />
✅ Dynamic Object Placement: Users can define and modify object positions in real-time.<br />
✅ Realistic 2D/3D Transformations: Implements translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection.<br />
✅ Lighting and Shading: Enhances visual realism with OpenGL lighting models.<br />
✅ Perspective Projection: Provides depth and spatial accuracy for immersive scenes.

# How It Works:

1️⃣ User Inputs: Define object dimensions and positions dynamically.<br />
2️⃣ 3D Rendering: Uses OpenGL to visualize the defined elements in real-time.<br />
3️⃣ Interactive Simulation: Users navigate and manipulate objects efficiently.<br />
4️⃣ Seamless Updates: The interface refreshes dynamically with changes.<br />

# Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: C++<br />
- Graphics Library: OpenGL<br />
- Development Tools: DevCPP<br />
